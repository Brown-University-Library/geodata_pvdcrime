FACILITY_Sites_E911.shp goes in this folder

Note that the E911 file is occasionally updated, and new versions should be downloaded from RIGIS and placed here.

During the last update in July 2024, the name of the file changed, and it was in a different coordinate reference system. I transformed the system to WGS84 and changed the name to avoid making changes in the notebook.
